/* This SQL code will look into 5 different tables: regional_sales, Sales, Order, Product, Customer.
The code will answer these questions.
1. Which Sales channel had the least amount of Unit profit, the most? Which Warehouse offeres the most Profit?
2. What sales team work with what state the most, what region? Which region offered the most profit?
3. Which Sales DIstributor had the Most sales? How much is the order quantity?
4. Which proudct was sold most? Which Sales team Sold this the most?
5. How many orders were either very profitbale, somewhat, etc.?
6. What was the average distance between Order date and Ship date?
7. Which Store offered the most discount? What Sales team?
8. What customer segment ordered the most? What Ship mode most was used for each region? 
These questions will go more in depth if need 
Thank you for looking into this project! */
